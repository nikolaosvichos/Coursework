# Context

## 2016 U.S. Presidential Election

-   The 2016 election was an unprecedented rupture, marked by extreme polarization and norm violations.

-   Trump’s campaign used racialized appeals, anti-immigration rhetoric, and, most importantly, attacks on instutions and the media.

-   Long-standing political norms—transparency, restraint, constitutional conventions—were openly disregarded.

-   Young voters entering political life in 2016 faced a uniquely antagonistic and norm-breaking environment.

### Research question

*Does coming of age during this disruptive election affect long-term media trust?*

# Literature Review

## Literature Review (Formative Periods & Political Development)

\small

**Early Life & Early Adulthood**

-   Early adversity shapes long-term attitudes/behaviors [@shonkoff2012; @bellucci2020]
-   Early adulthood = second sensitive period; identities remain malleable [@masten2004; @arnett2000]

**Political Development**

-   First political encounters crystallize worldviews [@mannheim1928]
-   Civic experiences and social environment shape long-term engagement [@wray-lake2023; @sagawa2010]
-   Cohort effects: political climate of youth has lasting influence [@ghitza2023; @grasso2014]

**First Election Effects**

-   First elections form lasting turnout habits and shape partisanship [@plutzer2002; @dinas2012; @meredith2009]

\normalsize

## Literature Review (Elite Norms & Democratic Backsliding)

**Elite Cues & Public Response**

-   Citizens respond to elite norm violations, legitimizing or resisting them [@druckman2024]
-   Fear of opposing party subversion increases tolerance for undemocratic actions [@braley2023]
-   Polarization reduces willingness to punish copartisans for violations [@graham2020]

**Relevance to 2016**

-   Trump era = major elite norm breach.
-   Exposure during coming-of-age may shape long-term support for media freedom.
-   Study examines whether ages 18–25 in this context altered media attitudes.

# Theoretical Framework

## Theory and Hypotheses

\small

**First Encounters with Democracy**

-   **H1:** Negative effect on liberal attitudes *(‘first-time sensitivity’)*.

**Partisan Sensitivity**

-   Partisans more responsive to political cues; independents less engaged and influenced [@magleby2011; @mandel2014]

-   **H2:** First-time voting effect stronger for partisans than independents *(‘non-partisan insensitivity’).*

**Asymmetric Sensitivity**

-   Republicans more affectively sensitive to political context than Democrats [@carraro2011; @mandel2014]
-   **H3:** Within partisans, effect stronger for Republicans than Democrats (*‘asymmetric sensitivity’).*

# Research Design

## Methodology and Data

**Data**

-   2020 ANES,

**Design**

-   Sharp RDD compares those eligible to vote in 2012 vs. 2016 (age 26 cutoff in 2020).

-   Simulates as-if random assignment to “conventional” vs. “unconventional” political environment

**Outcome: Media Trust Index**

-   Constructed from 2020 ANES items on media trust, journalist access, and concerns about media freedom.

-   Factor analysis creates a 0–1 continuous index.

## RDD Equation

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + f(X_i - c) + \varepsilon_i
$$

\small

Where:

-   $Y_i$ is the outcome, a continuous index measuring liberal attitudes.
-   $D_i$ is an indicator equal to 1 if individual $i$’s age *exceeds* the cutoff (i.e., they were just *eligible* to vote in 2012), and 0 otherwise.\[\^3\]
-   $\tau$ is the parameter of interest, capturing the size of the discontinuity at the threshold—that is, the causal effect of being first eligible to vote in 2012 rather than in 2016.
-   $X_i$ is the running variable, the respondent’s age in years in 2020.
-   $f(X_i - c)$ denotes a flexible function (e.g., first- or second-order polynomial) of the centered running variable—distance from the cutoff $c$.
-   $c = 26$ is the cutoff point, so $X_i - c$ represents the running variable centered at the threshold.
-   $\varepsilon_i$ is an error term.

## Questions/Concerns

-   Sharp RDD according to eligibility or Fuzzy RDD according to first-time voting?
