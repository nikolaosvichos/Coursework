# Context

## 2016 U.S. Presidential Election

-   The 2016 election was an unprecedented rupture, marked by extreme polarization and norm violations.

-   Trump’s campaign used racialized appeals, anti-immigration rhetoric, and, most importantly, attacks on instutions and the media.

-   Long-standing political norms—transparency, restraint, constitutional conventions—were openly disregarded.

-   Young voters entering political life in 2016 faced a uniquely antagonistic and norm-breaking environment.

### Research question

*Does coming of age during this disruptive election affect long-term media trust?*

# Literature Review

## Literature Review (Formative Periods & Political Development)

\small

**Early Life & Early Adulthood**

-   Early adversity shapes long-term attitudes/behaviors [@shonkoff2012; @bellucci2020]
-   Early adulthood = second sensitive period; identities remain malleable [@masten2004; @arnett2000]

**Political Development**

-   First political encounters crystallize worldviews [@mannheim1928]
-   Civic experiences and social environment shape long-term engagement [@wray-lake2023; @sagawa2010]
-   Cohort effects: political climate of youth has lasting influence [@ghitza2023; @grasso2014]

**First Election Effects**

-   First elections form lasting turnout habits and shape partisanship [@plutzer2002; @dinas2012; @meredith2009]

\normalsize

## Literature Review (Elite Norms & Democratic Backsliding)

**Elite Cues & Public Response**

-   Citizens respond to elite norm violations, legitimizing or resisting them [@druckman2024]
-   Fear of opposing party subversion increases tolerance for undemocratic actions [@braley2023]
-   Polarization reduces willingness to punish copartisans for violations [@graham2020]

**Relevance to 2016**

-   Trump era = major elite norm breach.
-   Exposure during coming-of-age may shape long-term support for media freedom.
-   Study examines whether ages 18–25 in this context altered media attitudes.

# Theoretical Framework

## Theory and Hypotheses

\small

**First Encounters with Democracy**

-   **H1:** Negative effect on liberal attitudes *(‘first-time sensitivity’)*.

**Partisan Sensitivity**

-   Partisans more responsive to political cues; independents less engaged and influenced [@magleby2011; @mandel2014]

-   **H2:** First-time voting effect stronger for partisans than independents *(‘non-partisan insensitivity’).*

**Asymmetric Sensitivity**

-   Republicans more affectively sensitive to political context than Democrats [@carraro2011; @mandel2014]
-   **H3:** Within partisans, effect stronger for Republicans than Democrats (*‘asymmetric sensitivity’).*

# Research Design

## Methodology and Data

**Design**

-   Sharp RDD compares first-time voters in 2012 vs. 2016 (age 26 cutoff in 2020).

-   Simulates as-if random assignment to “conventional” vs. “unconventional” political environment

**Outcome: Media Trust Index**

-   Constructed from 2020 ANES items on media trust, independence, and access.

-   Factor analysis creates a 0–1 continuous index.

**Data**

-   2020 ANES, nationally representative, rich in political and media-trust measures.
