# Introduction

## Texts and Research Focus

### @massoc2019 : “Taxing Stock Transfers in the First Golden Age of Financial Capitalism: Political Salience and the Limits on the Power of Finance” 

-   Why did powerful financial actors fail to prevent the adoption of stock-transfer taxes in France and New York?
-   **Focus**: how public discontent + political framing raised salience and undermined “quiet politics.”

### @feldmann2021 : “Brexit and British Business Elites: Business Power and Noisy Politics"

-   Under what conditions can business elites be effective in a context of noisy politics, and why did their influence differ between 1975 and 2016?
-   **Focus**: how incentives, legitimacy, and cohesion shape business influence in high-politicization referendum campaigns.

## What brings these papers together?

Both papers examine how political visibility and public contestation reshape business/financial influence

-   @massoc2019 shows how politicization of a tax issue enabled politicians to override strong financial lobbying.

-   @feldmann2021 analyze how changing political conditions over time affect business effectiveness in high-visibility referendum campaigns.\

### **Common Question**

-   *Under what conditions do business actors struggle to assert influence?*

# Theoretical Framework and Important Concepts: Noisy Politics

## Culpepper’s Framework: Quiet vs. Noisy Politics

**Core hypothesis:** The more the public cares about an issue, the less business can exercise influence over regulation. Business power decreases as political salience increases [@culpepper2021]. \small

```{=latex}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.48\textwidth} p{0.48\textwidth}}
\hline
\textbf{Quiet Politics} & \textbf{Noisy Politics} \\
\hline
Issues are technically complex and low in public salience. Business dominates through expertise monopoly and structural dependence. &
Issues become publicly salient and politicized. Media attention and public engagement constrain business influence and organizations become cautious and may avoid public positioning. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
```

-   **Three forms of business power**: structural, instrumental, and ideational
-   **The challenge**: Business power persists even in noisy politics through technical complexity, strategic network-building, and control of core growth sectors.

# Side-By-Side: Paper Summaries and Critical Discussion

## @feldmann2021 : Brexit and British Business Elites

**The question**: When can business elites influence “noisy politics”? Comparing EU Referenda

**Three determinants of business effectiveness**:

![](Screenshot%202025-11-18%20at%2014.13.03.png){fig-align="center" width="330"}

**The mechanism**

-   1975: Unified business presence in workplaces → counter-framing succeeds

-   2016: Fragmented business silent or hedging → anti-establishment framing dominates

## @massoc2019 **:** Stock Transfer Tax & Political Salience

**The puzzle:** Same anti-finance sentiment → Different outcomes.

**Why?**

### 1903: Stock transfer tax proposed

↓ Public anger: \textcolor{mygreen}{Financial crisis + anti-finance sentiment}

↓ Finance opposition: \textcolor{mygreen}{Massive}

→ **Outcome:** \textcolor{red}{Rejected}

### 1905: Stock transfer tax proposed (same tax!)

↓ Public anger: \textcolor{mygreen}{Same level}

↓ Finance opposition: \textcolor{mygreen}{Same level}

→Difference: Political champions (Senators Lewis & Raines) publicly framed issue

→ **Outcome:** \textcolor{mygreen}{Passed}

## The answer: Framing creates salience

It requires political entrepreneurs who:

-   Reframe complexity as simple antagonism (“finance vs. people”)

-   Have incentive to alienate finance (party positioning)

-   Actively publicize the issue (top-down process)

-   Same structural conditions; different political choices = different outcomes

## Critical review – What actually causes business defeat?

**Framing as a cause – Massoc’s logic:**

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{Shows political agency matters}

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{Same conditions → different framing = different outcomes}

-   \textcolor{red}{Does not explain why framing succeeds in some contexts not others}

**Elite fragmentation as a cause – Feldmann & Morgan’s logic:**

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{Shows structural vulnerability enables defeats}

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{975 cohesion defeats framing attempts; 2016 fragmentation allows framing to succeed}

-   \textcolor{red}{Does not explain how fragmentation becomes politically visible}

# Synthesis: What Brings These Papers Together?

## Two Sides of the Business–Politics Struggle

The papers map the conditions that shift the balance in favor of politicians or business. 

### **Two axes of analysis**

-   *“Anti-Business Offense” vs “Business Defense”*

    -   Massoc: How can political actors mount an effective anti-business offense?

    -   Feldmann and Morgan: When can business can (or cannot) successfully defend itself in noisy politics?  

-   *Noisy Politics Manicheanism: From New York and France to Brexit*

## Anti-Business Offense” vs “Business Defense”

**Massoc: Anti-Business Offense**

-   Offense is politically constructed, not automatic.

-   Politicians create salience and frame issues in moral, binary terms.

-   Framing channels diffuse public anger into a focused attack on finance.

**Feldmann and Morgan: Business Defense**

Business defense works only when three conditions align:

1.  Incentives to engage — business must see existential stakes.

2.  Legitimacy — messages must be perceived as serving the public, not narrow interests.

3.  Cohesion — unified signaling increases credibility and influence

## Anti-Business Offense” vs “Business Defense”

-   @massoc2019 explains how politicians win by activating the offense whereas @feldmann2021 explain how business can (or cannot) counterattack.

-   Offense gains power when issues are moralized, simplified, and made public. Under the same conditions, business loses:

    -   Harder to mobilize

    -   Less legitimate

    -   More divided

### In brief

-   Massoc describes the conditions for business defeat; Feldmann and Morgan describe the mechanics of business resistance.

-   A full political-economy picture emerges only when offense and defense are examined together.

## Manicheanism

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *“Politics is a struggle between good and evil. \[...\] The Manichean worldview sees the struggle between opposing camps as an inherently moral one.”* [@jungkunz2021] |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Manicheanism in @massoc2019 and @feldmann2021

-   @massoc2019

    -   Central to the offense: “Speculators vs. workers”

    -   Turns a technical tax into a moral crusade, neutralizing expert arguments.

-   @feldmann2021

    -   Not named as “manicheanism,” but structurally identical: Brexit as “the people vs. the establishment.”

    -   Business expertise becomes delegitimized (“Project Fear”).

    -   Manicheanism collapses the three conditions for effective business defense.

## Synthesizing Manicheanism

**Manicheanism as the bridge between defense and offense**

-   Manichean framing empowers anti-business offense

-   It simultaneously undermines business defense by:

    -   Making business appear self-interested

    -   Casting warnings as elite manipulation

    -   Punishing technocratic/complex messaging

    -   Fragmenting business coalitions

**Across contexts separated by a century, Manichean politics reorders power:**

-   Politicians gain room to attack

-   Business loses the capacity to respond

## Who Pulls the Trigger?: Incumbents’ Silence (Session 3/4) vs. Underdog’s Noise (Session 9)

 **Why Noise: The engine for Democratic Cycling**

-   **Incumbents**: Prefer *silence* ("quiet politics") to *maintain structural/ instrumental power*

-   **Underdog**: Need *noise* ("noisy politics") to mobilize the majority and *challenge established powers*

**→ Noisy Politics as a “*safety valve*” for Democracy**

## The Hollow Shot? Winning the War of Votes, Losing the Battle of Implementation

\footnotesize

### **After the Strike**

-   **The Shot (Political Win):** Simplification successfully breaks the shield → *Law Passed.*

-   **The Trap (Implementation Gap):** Simple moral language fails to control technical details during implementation.

→ **Result:** "The Hollow Shot" → Political Victory $\not=$ Regulatory Success

### **Evidence: The Hollow Aftermath**

-   **The Cunning Recapture:** 1905 New York (Massoc, 2017)\
    → The STT laws adopted (1905)\
    → *"special arrangements and exemptions"* via *technical lobbying***\
    **→ *Regulatory Failure* (tax revenues declined)

-   **The Incompetent Chaos**: 2016 Brexit (Feldmann & Morgan, 2021)\
    → Won the Brexit Vote (52%)\
    → *“chaotic negotiations”* post-referendum\
    → *Regulatory Gridlock* (complex trade realities overwhelmed the simple mandate)

# Conclusion and Discussion

## The Double-Edged Sword of Noise

**The Conditions for Victory (How to Win)**

-   **Business power** is not absolute. It breaks when simple, moral framing [@massoc2019] meets *elite fragmentation* [@feldmann2021]

**The Costs of Victory**

-   **Institutional Stability**: Undermining the Enforcement Pyramid

-   **Epistemic Consensus**: Destroying the “shared facts”

-    **Regulatory Implementation**: Ignoring the technical complexity

## The Path Forward

-   Noisy politics is a powerful *shock treatment* to break a “Quiet Politics” deadlock…

-   …but it may not be a *sustainable solution* for long-term regulatory governance

###  

→ True change requires using the *noise* to *open the door,*\
then building **new** **consensus** and **counter**-**expertise** to walk through it.

## Discussion

\small

-   How should we explain phenomena like *"woke capitalism"* (e.g., ESG, PC issues), where incumbents actively generate noise or leverage social issues for their benefit? Is this an evolution of Massoc's (2017) framing strategy?

-   Could new models like *citizens’ assemblies* or *deliberative polling* be the alternative – safely bringing “public noise” inside the institutional framework for deliberation?

-   If *simplification* is a prerequisite for political victory, how should complex technical regulations (e.g., AI, Climate Finance) be communicated to the public?

-   Should regulatory experts: (a) retreat deeper into *quiet politics* to avoid political attacks, or (b) jump into the center of noisy politics and actively engage in public persuasion?

-   @feldmann2021 focused on the UK, a liberal market economy. Would noisy politics have the same destructive power in coordinated market economies like Germany or Japan?
