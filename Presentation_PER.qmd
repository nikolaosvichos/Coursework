# Introduction

## Texts

-   Massoc, Elsa. 2019. “Taxing Stock Transfers in the First Golden Age of Financial Capitalism: Political Salience and the Limits on the Power of Finance.” *Socio-Economic Review* 17 (3): 503–22. https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwx039.
-   Feldmann, Magnus, and Glenn Morgan. 2021. “Brexit and British Business Elites: Business Power and Noisy Politics.” *Politics & Society* 49 (1): 107–31. https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329220985692.

## Research Focus

### @massoc2019 :

-   Why did powerful financial actors fail to prevent the adoption of stock-transfer taxes in France and New York?
-   **Focus**: how public discontent + political framing raised salience and undermined “quiet politics.”

### @feldmann2021:

-   Under what conditions can business elites be effective in a context of noisy politics, and why did their influence differ between 1975 and 2016?
-   **Focus**: how incentives, legitimacy, and cohesion shape business influence in high-politicization referendum campaigns.

## What brings these papers together?

Both papers examine how political visibility and public contestation reshape business/financial influence

-   @massoc2019 shows how politicization of a tax issue enabled politicians to override strong financial lobbying.

-   @feldmann2021 analyze how changing political conditions over time affect business effectiveness in high-visibility referendum campaigns.\

### **Common Question**

-   *Under what conditions do business actors struggle to assert influence?*

## Culpepper’s Framework: Quiet vs. Noisy Politics

**Core hypothesis:** The more the public cares about an issue, the less business can exercise influence over regulation. Business power decreases as political salience increases [@culpepper2021]. \small

```{=latex}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.48\textwidth} p{0.48\textwidth}}
\hline
\textbf{Quiet Politics} & \textbf{Noisy Politics} \\
\hline
Issues are technically complex and low in public salience. Business dominates through expertise monopoly and structural dependence. &
Issues become publicly salient and politicized. Media attention and public engagement constrain business influence and organizations become cautious and may avoid public positioning. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
```

\normalsize

-   **Three forms of business power**: structural, instrumental, and ideational
-   **The challenge**: Business power persists even in noisy politics through technical complexity, strategic network-building, and control of core growth sectors.

## @feldmann2021 : Brexit and British Business Elites

**The question**: When can business elites influence “noisy politics”? Comparing EU Referenda

**Three determinants of business effectiveness**:

![](Screenshot%202025-11-18%20at%2014.13.03.png){fig-align="center" width="330"}

**The mechanism**

-   1975: Unified business presence in workplaces → counter-framing succeeds

-   2016: Fragmented business silent or hedging → anti-establishment framing dominates

## @massoc2019 **:** Stock Transfer Tax & Political Salience

**The puzzle:** Same anti-finance sentiment → Different outcomes.

**Why?**

### 1903: Stock transfer tax proposed

↓ Public anger: \textcolor{mygreen}{Financial crisis + anti-finance sentiment}

↓ Finance opposition: \textcolor{mygreen}{Massive}

→ **Outcome:** \textcolor{red}{Rejected}

### 1905: Stock transfer tax proposed (same tax!)

↓ Public anger: \textcolor{mygreen}{Same level}

↓ Finance opposition: \textcolor{mygreen}{Same level}

→Difference: Political champions (Senators Lewis & Raines) publicly framed issue

→ **Outcome:** \textcolor{mygreen}{Passed}

## The answer: Framing creates salience

It requires political entrepreneurs who:

-   Reframe complexity as simple antagonism (“finance vs. people”)

-   Have incentive to alienate finance (party positioning)

-   Actively publicize the issue (top-down process)

-   Same structural conditions; different political choices = different outcomes

## Critical review – What actually causes business defeat?

**Framing as a cause – Massoc’s logic:**

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{Shows political agency matters}

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{Same conditions → different framing = different outcomes}

-   \textcolor{red}{Does not explain why framing succeeds in some contexts not others}

**Elite fragmentation as a cause – Feldmann & Morgan’s logic:**

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{Shows structural vulnerability enables defeats}

-   \textcolor{mygreen}{975 cohesion defeats framing attempts; 2016 fragmentation allows framing to succeed}

-   \textcolor{red}{Does not explain how fragmentation becomes politically visible}
